angular\nInstrumentation : use instrumentation from opentelemetry-js with web plugins (You need to install and configure it) like : \n@opentelemetry/instrumentation-document-load\n@opentelemetry/instrumentation-fetch\n@opentelemetry/instrumentation-xml-http-request\n...\n\n\n\nInstallation\nWith npm :\nnpm i

No component needs now\nInterceptor Module And Instrumentation Module\nDon't use them at the same time : you're going to have the same trace twice.\nInjection token\nThis library exposes injection token.\nYou can use them to override or customize. \n\nOTEL_EXPORTER : token to inject an implementation of IExporter\nOTEL_PROPAGATOR : token to inject an implementation of IPropagator\nOTEL_CONFIG : token to inject an OpenTelemetryConfig\nOTEL_INSTRUMENTATION_PLUGINS : token to inject an InstrumentationOption array\nOTEL_LOGGER : more info in (Optional) Logging in OtelColExporterModule\nOTEL_CUSTOM_SPAN : more infor in (Optional) Add span attributes during interception\n\n(Optional) Logging in OtelColExporterModule\nYou can add a logger to the OtelColExporterModule with the OTEL_LOGGER token.\nYou can use a custom logger which implements the DiagLogger in @opentelemetry/api.\nOr, you can use an existing logger which implements the same functions (error, warn, info, debug) like ngx-logger.\nNGXLogger\nYou can use ngx-logger.\nIn your appModule, insert LoggerModule and configure it\n@NgModule({\n  ...\n  imports: [\n    LoggerModule.forRoot(environment.loggerConfig),\n  ]\n  ...And use OTEL_LOGGER token to inject NGXLogger\n@NgModule({\n  ...\n  providers: [\n    ...\n    { provide: OTEL_LOGGER, useExisting: NGXLogger }\n    ...\n  ]Don't forget to set \"logLevel\" in Common Configuration (Level must be the same between NGXLogger and common configuration)\n\nYou can see an example in the interceptor-example.\n\n(Optional) Add span attributes during interception\nThis option is only available for Interceptor Module\nImplement a CustomSpan and the method add(span: Span, request: HttpRequest, response: HttpResponse | HttpErrorResponse): Span\n\nspan : Current span, you can set or get attributes\nrequest : Current request in interceptor\nresponse : Current response in interceptor\n\nImplement CustomSpan class like : \nclass CustomSpanImpl implements CustomSpan {\n  add(span: Span, request: HttpRequest, response: HttpResponse | HttpErrorResponse): Span {\n    span.setAttribute('mycustom.key', request.params + \";\" + response.status);\n    return span;\n  }\n}Inject it in you App module with OTEL_CUSTOM_SPAN :\n@NgModule({\n  ...\n  providers: [\n    ...\n    { provide: OTEL_CUSTOM_SPAN, useClass: CustomSpanImpl }\n    ...\n  ]\nYou can see an example in the interceptor-example.\n\nHow it works\nThis library is based on HttpClientModule and the HTTP_INTERCEPTORS\nOpenTelemetryInterceptor implement an HttpInterceptor and the intercept method.\nThis implementation initialise a WebTracerProvider, create a Span and add header propagation in the current call.\n\nThe response body is adding by an event in span.\n\nExample\nThis project has two example Angular Application:\n\nprojects/interceptor-example\nprojects/instrumentation-example\n\nYou can see how configure and insert all modules.\nYou can althought test opentelemetry-angular-interceptor with this two applications.\nRun\nInterceptor\nTo start this Interceptor example application, run command :\nnpm run start:complete-interceptor-exampleand open the application at http://localhost:4200\nInstrumentation\nTo start this Instrumentation example application, run command :\nnpm run start:complete-instrumentation-exampleand open the application at http://localhost:4200\n[Optional] Result in OpenTelemetry-collector\nIf you want to see the result in a collector *, there's a docker-compose available in this project.\nYou can start it with this command :\ndocker-compose -f collector/docker-compose.yaml up -dGo to the jaeger application (http://localhost:16686) to see result.\nMore info about the collector here : https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector\n\n* without an Agent or a Collector you can see an error in your browser about sending a \"trace\".\n\nTroubleshoot\nAngular 10 Warning\nWARNING in xxx/fesm2015/jufab-opentelemetry-angular-interceptor.js depends on '@opentelemetry/web'.
