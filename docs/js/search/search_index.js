angular\nInstrumentation : use instrumentation from opentelemetry-js with web plugins (You need to install and configure it) like : \n@opentelemetry/instrumentation-document-load\n@opentelemetry/instrumentation-fetch\n@opentelemetry/instrumentation-xml-http-request\n...\n\n\n\nInstallation\nWith npm :\nExample :npm i @jufab/opentelemetry-angular-interceptorConfiguration\nUse the \"OpentelemetryConfig\" interface to configure the Tracer\nExample :export interface OpenTelemetryConfig {\n  commonConfig: CommonCollectorConfig;\n  batchSpanProcessorConfig?: BatchSpanProcessorConfig;\n  otelcolConfig?: OtelCollectorConfig;\n  jaegerPropagatorConfig?: JaegerPropagatorConfig;\n  zipkinConfig?: ZipkinCollectorConfig;\n  b3PropagatorConfig?: B3PropagatorConfig;\n  ignoreUrls?: IgnoreUrlsConfig;\n}Example global Configuration\nFrom the interceptor-example\nExample :opentelemetryConfig: {\n    commonConfig: {\n      console: true, //(boolean) Display trace on console\n      production: false, //(boolean) Send trace with BatchSpanProcessor (true) or SimpleSpanProcessor (false)\n      logBody: true, //(boolean) true add body in a log, nothing otherwise\n      serviceName: 'interceptor-example', //Service name send in trace\n      resourceAttributes: { // extra resource attributes like service.namespace\n        [SemanticResourceAttributes.SERVICE_NAMESPACE]: 'namespace'\n      },\n      probabilitySampler: '0.7', //Samples a configurable percentage of traces, string value between '0' to '1'\n      logLevel:DiagLogLevel.ALL //(Enum) DiagLogLevel is an Enum from @opentelemetry/api\n    },\n    batchSpanProcessorConfig: { //Only if production = true in commonConfig\n      maxQueueSize: '2048', // The maximum queue size. After the size is reached spans are dropped.\n      maxExportBatchSize: '512', // The maximum batch size of every export. It must be smaller or equal to maxQueueSize.\n      scheduledDelayMillis: '5000', // The interval between two consecutive exports\n      exportTimeoutMillis: '30000', // How long the export can run before it is cancelled\n    },\n    otelcolConfig: {\n      url: 'http://localhost:4318/v1/traces', //URL of opentelemetry collector\n    },\n    jaegerPropagatorConfig: {\n      customHeader: 'custom-header',\n    }\n  }From the instrumentation-example\nExample :backendApp.get('/api/config', (req,res) => {\n  return res.status(200).send({\n    commonConfig: {\n      console: true, // Display trace on console\n      production: true, // Send Trace with BatchSpanProcessor (true) or SimpleSpanProcessor (false)\n      serviceName: 'instrumentation-example', // Service name send in trace\n      resourceAttributes: { // extra resource attributes like service.namespace\n        'service.namespace': 'namespace'\n      },\n      probabilitySampler: '0.75', // 75% sampling\n      logLevel: 99 //ALL Log, DiagLogLevel is an Enum from @opentelemetry/api\n    },\n    otelcolConfig: {\n      url: 'http://localhost:4318/v1/traces', // URL of opentelemetry collector\n    }\n  });\n})\nCommon Configuration\n\nconsole: (boolean) Display trace on console if true\nproduction: (boolean)Send trace via BatchSpanProcessor (Async) or SimpleSpanProcessor (Sync) : It's recommend to use BatchSpanProcessor on Production.\nserviceName: (string) Service name in your trace\nresourceAttributes: list of extra resource attributes\nprobabilitySampler: (string) Samples a configurable percentage of traces, value between 0 to 1\nlogBody: (boolean) true add body in a log, nothing otherwise\nlogLevel: (DiagLogLevel) log level\n\nBatchSpanProcessor Configuration\nThis configuration applies if production is true in commonConfig.\n\nmaxQueueSize: (string) The maximum queue size. After the size is reached spans are dropped.\nmaxExportBatchSize: (string) The maximum batch size of every export. It must be smaller or equal to maxQueueSize.\nscheduledDelayMillis: (string) The interval between two consecutive exports\nexportTimeoutMillis: (string) How long the export can run before it is cancelled\n\nOpenTelemetry-collector Configuration\n\nurl: (string) url of opentelemetry collector (default : http://localhost:4318/v1/traces)\nheaders: list of custom header (more info: https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-js/tree/main/experimental/packages/exporter-trace-otlp-http)\nconcurrencyLimit (string) : An optional limit on pending requests (more info : https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-js/tree/main/experimental/packages/exporter-trace-otlp-http)\ntimeoutMillis (string): Maximum time the OTLP exporter will wait for each batch export. The default value is 10000ms (more info : https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-js/tree/main/experimental/packages/exporter-trace-otlp-http)\n\nJaeger Propagator Configuration\n\ncustomHeader: (string) custom header (more info : https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-js/tree/main/packages/opentelemetry-propagator-jaeger)\n\nZipkin Exporter Configuration\n\nurl: (string) url of zipkin collector (default : http://localhost:9411/api/v2/spans)\nheaders: list of custom header (more info : https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-js/tree/main/packages/opentelemetry-exporter-zipkin)\n\nB3 Propagator Configuration\n\nmultiHeader : (string) Single or Multi Header for b3propagator (default: multi). Value : 'O' (single), '1' (multi) (more info: https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-js/tree/main/packages/opentelemetry-propagator-b3)\n\nIgnore URL Configuration\n\nurls : (Array) URLs that partially match any regex in ignoreUrls will not be traced. In addition, URLs that are exact matches of strings in ignoreUrls will also not be traced\n\nExternal Configuration\nInstrumentation example project have an external configuration to show how you can do it.\nAngular module\nYou need 3 modules to add to your application.\n\nExporter Module : to define type and export of traces.\nPropagator Module : to define propagation in your HTTP header.\nLast Module, 2 choices :  \nOpenTelemetryInterceptorModule : to activate interceptor in all your http call.\nOtelWebTracerModule : to activate instrumentation (you need a component to activate it, see Component otel-instrumentation).\n\n\n\nCommons Module\nYou add this modules in your application module (generally app.module.ts)\nExporter module\nThere is 4 exporters:\n\nNoopSpanExporterModule : This a fake exporter\nOtelColExporterModule : OpenTelemetry exporter (more info : https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-js/tree/main/experimental/packages/opentelemetry-exporter-trace-otlp-http)\nConsoleSpanExporterModule : Console Exporter\nZipkinExporterModule : Zipkin Exporter (more info : https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-js/tree/main/packages/opentelemetry-exporter-zipkin)\n\nPropagator module\nthere is 6 propagators (more info about propagator: https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-js/tree/main/packages/opentelemetry-core)\n\nNoopHttpTextPropagatorModule : This is a fake propagator\nB3PropagatorModule : Use B3 propagator\nW3CTraceContextPropagatorModule : Use W3CTraceContext propagator\nJaegerHttpTracePropagatorModule : Use JaegerHttpPropagator (more info about this one: https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-js/tree/main/packages/opentelemetry-propagator-jaeger)\nAwsXrayPropagatorModule : Use AWS X-Ray propagator\nCompositePropagatorModule : use all of the propagator\n\nInterceptor Module\nJust add OpenTelemetryInterceptorModule to insert Interceptor\nExample :import { NgModule } from '@angular/core';\n...\nimport { AppComponent } from './app.component';\nimport { HttpClientModule } from '@angular/common/http';\nimport { OpenTelemetryInterceptorModule, OtelColExporterModule, CompositePropagatorModule } from '@jufab/opentelemetry-angular-interceptor';\nimport { environment } from '../environments/environment';\n...\n\n@NgModule({\n  declarations: [AppComponent, ...],\n  imports: [\n    ...\n    HttpClientModule,\n    //Insert module OpenTelemetryInterceptorModule with configuration, HttpClientModule is used for interceptor\n    OpenTelemetryInterceptorModule.forRoot(environment.opentelemetryConfig),\n    //Insert OtelCol exporter module\n    OtelColExporterModule,\n    //Insert propagator module\n    CompositePropagatorModule,\n    ...\n  ],\n  providers: [],\n  bootstrap: [AppComponent],\n})\nexport class AppModule {}Instrumentation Module\nDeclare this OtelWebTracerModule to configure instrumentation.\nYou need to provide Web instrumentation on the OTEL_INSTRUMENTATION_PLUGINS token in providers section of NgModule\nExample in instrumentation-example project\nExample :...\nimport { OtelColExporterModule, CompositePropagatorModule, OtelWebTracerModule } from 'projects/opentelemetry-interceptor/src/public-api';\n...\n\n@NgModule({\n  declarations: [AppComponent, ...],\n  imports: [\n    ...\n    // OtelCol Exporter Module\n    OtelColExporterModule,\n    // Composite Propagator Module\n    CompositePropagatorModule,\n    // OtelWebTracerModule to configure instrumentation component.\n    OtelWebTracerModule.forRoot(environment.openTelemetryConfig),\n    ...\n  ],\n  providers: [\n    {provide: OTEL_INSTRUMENTATION_PLUGINS, useValue: [new XMLHttpRequestInstrumentation()]}\n  ],\n  bootstrap: [AppComponent],\n})\nexport class AppModule { }\nThis module uses APP_INITIALIZER token to load instrumentation (multi:true). No component needs now\nInterceptor Module And Instrumentation Module\nDon't use them at the same time : you're going to have the same trace twice.\nInjection token\nThis library exposes injection token.\nYou can use them to override or customize. \n\nOTEL_EXPORTER : token to inject an implementation of IExporter\nOTEL_PROPAGATOR : token to inject an implementation of IPropagator\nOTEL_CONFIG : token to inject an OpenTelemetryConfig\nOTEL_INSTRUMENTATION_PLUGINS : token to inject an InstrumentationOption array\nOTEL_LOGGER : more info in (Optional) Logging in OtelColExporterModule\nOTEL_CUSTOM_SPAN : more infor in (Optional) Add span attributes during interception\n\n(Optional) Logging in OtelColExporterModule\nYou can add a logger to the OtelColExporterModule with the OTEL_LOGGER token.\nYou can use a custom logger which implements the DiagLogger in @opentelemetry/api.\nOr, you can use an existing logger which implements the same functions (error, warn, info, debug) like ngx-logger.\nNGXLogger\nYou can use ngx-logger.\nIn your appModule, insert LoggerModule and configure it\nExample :@NgModule({\n  ...\n  imports: [\n    LoggerModule.forRoot(environment.loggerConfig),\n  ]\n  ...And use OTEL_LOGGER token to inject NGXLogger\nExample :@NgModule({\n  ...\n  providers: [\n    ...\n    { provide: OTEL_LOGGER, useExisting: NGXLogger }\n    ...\n  ]Don't forget to set \"logLevel\" in Common Configuration (Level must be the same between NGXLogger and common configuration)\n\nYou can see an example in the interceptor-example.\n\n(Optional) Add span attributes during interception\nThis option is only available for Interceptor Module\nImplement a CustomSpan and the method add(span: Span, request: HttpRequest, response: HttpResponse | HttpErrorResponse): Span\n\nspan : Current span, you can set or get attributes\nrequest : Current request in interceptor\nresponse : Current response in interceptor\n\nImplement CustomSpan class like : \nExample :class CustomSpanImpl implements CustomSpan {\n  add(span: Span, request: HttpRequest, response: HttpResponse | HttpErrorResponse): Span {\n    span.setAttribute('mycustom.key', request.params + \";\" + response.status);\n    return span;\n  }\n}Inject it in you App module with OTEL_CUSTOM_SPAN :\nExample :@NgModule({\n  ...\n  providers: [\n    ...\n    { provide: OTEL_CUSTOM_SPAN, useClass: CustomSpanImpl }\n    ...\n  ]\nYou can see an example in the interceptor-example.\n\nHow it works\nThis library is based on HttpClientModule and the HTTP_INTERCEPTORS\nOpenTelemetryInterceptor implement an HttpInterceptor and the intercept method.\nThis implementation initialise a WebTracerProvider, create a Span and add header propagation in the current call.\n\nThe response body is adding by an event in span.\n\nExample\nThis project has two example Angular Application:\n\nprojects/interceptor-example\nprojects/instrumentation-example\n\nYou can see how configure and insert all modules.\nYou can althought test opentelemetry-angular-interceptor with this two applications.\nRun\nInterceptor\nTo start this Interceptor example application, run command :\nExample :npm run start:complete-interceptor-exampleand open the application at http://localhost:4200\nInstrumentation\nTo start this Instrumentation example application, run command :\nExample :npm run start:complete-instrumentation-exampleand open the application at http://localhost:4200\n[Optional] Result in OpenTelemetry-collector\nIf you want to see the result in a collector *, there's a docker-compose available in this project.\nYou can start it with this command :\nExample :docker-compose -f collector/docker-compose.yaml up -dGo to the jaeger application (http://localhost:16686) to see result.\nMore info about the collector here : https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector\n\n* without an Agent or a Collector you can see an error in your browser about sending a \"trace\".\n\nTroubleshoot\nAngular 10 Warning\nExample :WARNING in xxx/fesm2015/jufab-opentelemetry-angular-interceptor.js depends on '@opentelemetry/web'.
