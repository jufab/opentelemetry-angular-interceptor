\"OpentelemetryConfig\" interface to configure the Tracer\nexport interface OpenTelemetryConfig {\n  commonConfig: CommonCollectorConfig;\n  otelcolConfig?: OtelCollectorConfig;\n  jaegerPropagatorConfig?: JaegerPropagatorConfig;\n}Example global Configuration\nFrom the example-app\nopentelemetryConfig: {\n    commonConfig: {\n      console: true, //(boolean) Display trace on console\n      production: false, //(boolean) Send trace with BatchSpanProcessor (true) or SimpleSpanProcessor (false) more info :

(string) custom header (more info : https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-js-contrib/tree/master/propagators/opentelemetry-propagator-jaeger)\n\nAngular module\nTo insert OpenTelemetryInterceptorModule, you can add in your application module (generally app.module.ts)\nExporter module\nThere is 2 exporters:\n\nOtelColExporterModule : OpenTelemetry exporter (more info : https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-js/tree/master/packages/opentelemetry-exporter-collector)\nConsoleSpanExporterModule : Console Exporter\n\nPropagator module\nthere is 5 propagators (more info about propagator: https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-js/tree/master/packages/opentelemetry-core)\n\nNoopHttpTextPropagatorModule : This is a fake propagator\nB3PropagatorModule : Use B3 propagator\nHttpTraceContextPropagatorModule : Use HttpTraceContext propagator\nJaegerHttpTracePropagatorModule : Use JaegerHttpPropagator (more info about this one: https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-js-contrib/tree/master/propagators/opentelemetry-propagator-jaeger)\nCompositePropagatorModule : use all of the propagator\n\nimport { NgModule } from '@angular/core';\n...\nimport { AppComponent } from './app.component';\nimport { HttpClientModule } from '@angular/common/http';\nimport { OpenTelemetryInterceptorModule, OtelColExporterModule, CompositePropagatorModule } from '@jufab/opentelemetry-angular-interceptor';\nimport { environment } from '../environments/environment';\n...\n\n@NgModule({\n  declarations: [AppComponent, ...],\n  imports: [\n    ...\n    HttpClientModule,\n    //Insert module OpenTelemetryInterceptorModule with configuration, HttpClientModule is used for interceptor\n    OpenTelemetryInterceptorModule.forRoot(environment.opentelemetryConfig),\n    //Insert OtelCol exporter module\n    OtelColExporterModule,\n    //Insert propagator module\n    CompositePropagatorModule,\n    ...\n  ],\n  providers: [],\n  bootstrap: [AppComponent],\n})\nexport class AppModule {}(Optional) Logging in OtelColExporterModule\nYou can add a logger to the OtelColExporterModule with the OTELCOL_LOGGER token.\nYou can use a custom logger which implements the Logger in @opentelemetry/api.\nOr, you can use an existing logger which implements the same functions (error, warn, info, debug) like ngx-logger.\nNGXLogger\nYou can use ngx-logger.\nIn your appModule, insert LoggerModule and configure it\n@NgModule({\n  ...\n  imports: [\n    LoggerModule.forRoot(environment.loggerConfig),\n  ]\n  ...And use OTELCOL_LOGGER token to inject NGXLogger\n@NgModule({\n  ...\n  providers: [\n    ...\n    { provide: OTELCOL_LOGGER, useExisting: NGXLogger }\n    ...\n  ]\nYou can see an example in the example-app.\n\nHow it works\nThis library is based on HttpClientModule and the HTTP_INTERCEPTORS\nOpenTelemetryInterceptor implement an HttpInterceptor and the intercept method.\nThis implementation initialise a WebTracerProvider, create a Span and add header propagation in the current call.\n\nThe response body is adding by an event in span.\n\nExample\nThis project have an \"example-app\" as Angular application example.\nprojects/example-app\nYou can see how configure and insert this module.\nYou can althought test opentelemetry-angular-interceptor with this application.\nRun\nTo start this Example application, run command :\nnpm run start:complete-example-appand open the application at http://localhost:4200\n[Optional] Result in OpenTelemtery-collector\nIf you want to see the result in a collector *, there's a docker-compose available in this project.\nYou can start it with this command :\ndocker-compose -f projects/example-app/collector/docker-compose.yaml up -dGo to the jaeger application (http://localhost:16686) to see result.\nMore info about the collector here : https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector\n\n* without an Agent or a Collector you can see an error in your browser about sending a \"trace\".\n\nTroubleshoot\nAngular 10
